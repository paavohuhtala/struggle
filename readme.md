# struggle

A simulated board game with a set of AI players of varying incompetence, based on the rules of [Trouble](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trouble_(board_game)>) / Frustration / Kimble. Inspired by [Elo World, a framework for benchmarking weak chess engines](http://tom7.org/chess/weak.pdf) by tom7.
